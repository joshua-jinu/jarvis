What was probably missing or unclear

no clear rules for variety (the model defaulted to repeating similar tasks).

no explicit time-breakdown (so tasks were vague and long).

no modality / activity constraints (e.g., “project vs. watch vs. quiz”), so it fell back on low-effort items.

no tone/engagement instructions (so output was dry).

no instructions for progression or adaptation (difficulty never changed).

no required output format (table vs. paragraph), causing inconsistent structure.

Specific prompt modifications (what I’d add) — each with why and what it fixes

Add a hard constraint for daily time blocks

Modification: “Each day must be exactly 2 hours total and split into 3 parts: Warm-up (15 min), Core hands-on activity (90 min), Reflection/mini-assessment (15 min).”

Why: prevents vague, repetitive activities and forces concise, actionable tasks.

Expected impact: realistic, uniform daily plans that fit the student’s schedule.

Force activity variety with a simple rule

Modification: “Across 7 days, include at least 4 different activity types (project/build, guided tutorial/video, quick challenge/problem, teaching/explain-back, micro-quiz). Do not repeat the same activity type more than twice.”

Why: avoids monotony and ensures mixed engagement modes.

Expected impact: each day feels different — some days are building, some are testing, some are synthesizing.

Emphasize hands-on, deliverable-focused tasks

Modification: “Core activity must produce a tiny deliverable (code snippet, sketch, experiment log, 1-paragraph explanation, short video recording).”

Why: makes the student actually do something rather than passively read.

Expected impact: higher engagement, tangible progress to show/iterate.

Ask for increasing difficulty & optional extensions

Modification: “Design difficulty to increase mid-week; include 1 optional ‘stretch challenge’ each day for +30–60 minutes.”

Why: keeps motivation and gives room for deeper practice.

Expected impact: the student can choose just-core or core+stretch depending on energy.

Require concrete materials & success criteria

Modification: “For each activity list: materials/resources (links or titles), exact time allocation, and a 1-sentence success criterion (how I’ll know I succeeded).”

Why: removes vagueness and makes self-checking possible.

Expected impact: more usable plan and easier self-assessment.

Specify tone and student-friendly voice

Modification: “Write in an encouraging, informal student voice (like ‘You got this — today’s mini project is…’).”

Why: increases readability and motivation.

Expected impact: plan feels friendly, not like a dry syllabus.

Demand an easy-to-scan format

Modification: “Return as a Markdown table: Day | Objective | Activity (with time) | Deliverable | Resources | Reflection prompt.”

Why: quick to read and follow.

Expected impact: I can open it and start without reformatting.


I’m a student with 2 hours/day for 7 days, and I learn best by doing. Make a 7-day hands-on plan (exactly 2 hours/day) using this template: Day | Goal | Activity (Warm-up 15m, Core 90m, Reflection 15m) | Deliverable | Resources | Reflection prompt. Use at least 4 activity types across the week (project, tutorial, challenge, teach-back, quiz) and don’t repeat any one type more than twice. Core activity must produce a tiny deliverable. Increase difficulty mid-week and add an optional 30–60m stretch challenge each day. Write in an encouraging student voice and include a one-sentence success criterion for every activity.
