Chat transcript (July 6, 2:11 PM): "Hi, I ordered a standing fan (Order #78945) on July 1st. It was supposed to come on July 3. Still no delivery. I paid for next-day delivery. Can someone tell me what’s going on?"



Follow-up Email 1 (July 9, 10:32 AM): "Still waiting. I called your helpline, was kept on hold for 26 mins and then cut off. No one got back to me. This is not acceptable. I’ve paid ₹340 for express and now it’s the 9th. My entire week’s schedule is ruined."



Follow-up Chat (July 11, 6:05 PM): "Your agent yesterday told me the fan had been shipped. Today I got a message saying it was delivered at 2 PM. NOTHING was delivered. I was home all day. No call, no knock. This is fake delivery."



Email escalation (July 13, 8:15 AM): "Now I’m told the delivery guy left it with ‘security.’ I live in an independent house. There IS no security! You’re just making excuses. Worst customer service I’ve ever seen. Tired of explaining again and again."



Final Email (July 16, 4:52 PM): "The fan finally arrived — box looks like it was in a warzone. Fan makes weird noises and stops after 2 minutes. I give up. Return it and refund EVERYTHING. I’m done. Absolutely ridiculous process. I’m never ordering again."

Subject: Regarding Escalation Ticket #452017 - Order #78945

Dear Mr. Ramesh,

Please accept our sincerest apologies for the series of unacceptable experiences you've had with your recent order (Order #78945). We understand this has caused you significant frustration and disappointment, and we take full responsibility for failing to meet your expectations and provide the level of service you deserve.

We have thoroughly reviewed your case (Ticket #452017) and understand that the issues encountered included a delayed delivery, poor communication from our support team, a false delivery claim, and ultimately, a damaged product. We recognize how infuriating this must have been, especially given that you paid for express delivery. The misinformation regarding delivery and the condition of the delivered fan are particularly concerning, and we deeply regret the distrust this has created. We truly value your business and are very sorry for letting you down.

Here is a summary of the key incidents:

| Date       | Issue                                         |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| July 3, 2025 | Original scheduled delivery date missed      |
| July 9, 2025 | Long hold time on helpline; call disconnected|
| July 11, 2025| False delivery claim                         |
| July 13, 2025| Misleading information about "security" drop-off|
| July 16, 2025| Damaged product received                      |

To address these issues and regain your trust, we propose the following resolution plan:

1.  **Full Refund:** We have already initiated a full refund for the purchase price of the standing fan, including the express delivery fee of ₹340. You should see the refund reflected in your account within 3-5 business days.

2.  **Return Authorization:** You do not need to return the damaged fan. Please dispose of it at your convenience.

3.  **Service Recovery Voucher:** As a gesture of goodwill, we would like to offer you a voucher worth ₹500 for use on any future purchase. We hope you will consider giving us another chance to demonstrate the quality of service we strive to provide.

4.  **Internal Review:** We are conducting a thorough internal review of the handling of your order to identify the root causes of these failures and implement corrective actions to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. This includes retraining for our support staff and a review of our delivery protocols.

We understand that this may not fully compensate for the inconvenience and frustration you have experienced, but we hope it demonstrates our commitment to resolving this issue.

Please do not hesitate to contact me directly if you have any further questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
